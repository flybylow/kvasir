# Knowledge Base Setup

## Problem

Need a systematic way to document problems and solutions to:
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Prevent getting caught in loops
- Build institutional knowledge
- Keep the codebase clean and maintainable

## Solution

Created a `docs` folder at the root of the project with the following structure:

1. **README.md**: Explains the purpose and structure of the knowledge base
2. **Numbered documentation files**: Each problem/solution gets its own file (e.g., `001-knowledge-base-setup.md`)

## Process

For everything we learn:
1. Create a new numbered file in the `docs` folder
2. Document:
   - Description of the problem
   - How we solved it
   - Any relevant context or lessons learned

## Rule #1: Always Keep the Wood Clean

This is the first rule: maintain clean, well-documented code and solutions. Document everything we learn to prevent future confusion and loops.
